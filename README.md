The game chosen to be recreated was Pacman. To Improve on its design, i decided to use shaders like The Flat Color Shader, Flat Color with Shadows, Scrolling Texture,The Hologram Shader and Rim Lighthing.

To Give Pacman his autentic look i decided to use a Flat Color with shaodws shader, that way he can be his usual Bright yellow but giving some 3d perspective with the utilization of shadows. it was super simple to implement and in the end i like how the result looks.
